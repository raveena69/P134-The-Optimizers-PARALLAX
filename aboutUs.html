                    <p id="about-us-first-part">Hello! My name is Nirosh Perera, the hand behind the paintings! 
                        Born and raised in Sri Lanka, I had the opportunity to venture into the tropical jungles to observe wildlife at close quarters. 
                        My interest in wildlife and specifically birds, started at a very young age, 
                        where my first endeavour was a series of Sri Lankan birds, 
                        drawn with felt pens for a school project. 
                        I was 12.

                <div id="second-box">
                    <p id="about-us-second-part">Although I didn't pursue art as a subject after the age of 16, 
                        I continued to paint animals and human portraits. 
                        It was not until 21, that I joined the Vibhavi Academy of Fine Arts, 
                        to gain the grounding I needed. Although I was very comfortable with pen and ink, 
                        I had not worked with pastels until I met Royden Gibbs in 2011, a renowned water colour artist. 
                        Under his tutelage, I started using soft pastels. 
                        Since then, 
                        I have honed my pastel rendering skills to produce realist-style paintings of animals.

                <div id="third-box">
                    <p id="about-us-third-part">I am also a wildlife photographer, 
                        as you will no doubt notice (hint: that's a Canon lens, not a cannon!). 
                        All the reference material for my wildlife paintings are from various excursions around Sri Lanka and England, 
                        with a handful of shot in other countries. I'm  Committee Member of the London Bird Club (part of the LNHS), 
                        and I regularly travel with the LBC and RSPB member groups all around the UK to do my part in the conservation of fauna and flora. 
                        I'm proud to say that a photograph I took of a Stonechat in New Forest adorns the back cover of the London Bird Atlas, 
                        which was recently published.
                        I currently reside in Balham, London. 
                        My home is also my studio, 
                        which I have set up in a way to get the most natural light.
